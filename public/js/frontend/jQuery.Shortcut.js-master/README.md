jQuery.Shortcut.js
==================

A jQuery-based Keybinding-Manager with a Backbone-inspired syntax

## Getting started

*jQuery.Shortcut.js* depends on jQuery. Include *jQuery.Shortcut.js* after jQuery.

	<script type="text/javascript" src="jQuery.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="jQuery.Shortcut.js"></script>

## Binding shortcuts

Use the `on` method to bind one or more keycombinations.

	// Syntax: $.Shortcut.on(keycombination, callback, [context]);
	$.Shortcut.on("ctrl + Z", function (e) {
		// e is the jQuery normalized KeyEvent
		undoManager.undo();
	})

	// Bind one callback to several keycombinations by passing 
	// an array of keycombinations
	$.Shortcut.on(["ctrl + Z", "meta + Z"], function (e) {
		undoManager.undo();
	})

Pass an object-literal to perform a bulk action.

	$.Shortcut.on({
		"LEFT": function () {
			// Left arrow key
		},
		"RIGHT": …,
		"alt+5": …,
		"ctrl+A": …,
		…
	}, context)

## Unbinding shortcuts

Use the `off` method to unbind one or more keycombinations.

	$.Shortcut.off("ctrl+Z")

	$.Shortcut.off(["ctrl+Z", "meta + Z"])

## List of available keys

Due to [complex cross-browser issues](http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html "unixpapa.com, JavaScript Madness: Keyboard Events") you can't just use any key you want. *jQuery.Shortcut.js* has an internal list of whitelisted keys you can use.

### Modifier keys

In combination with a key from the list of primary keys below you can use modifier keys.

- `"alt"`			The alt key.
- `"ctrl"`			The control key.
- `"meta"`			The meta key (if available).
- `"shift"`			The shift key.

### Primary keys

You need to have one of these primary keys in your keycombination.

- `"A"`				The "A" key.
- `"B"`				The "B" key.
- `"C"`				The "C" key.
- `"D"`				The "D" key.
- `"E"`				The "E" key.
- `"F"`				The "F" key.
- `"G"`				The "G" key.
- `"H"`				The "H" key.
- `"I"`				The "I" key.
- `"J"`				The "J" key.
- `"K"`				The "K" key.
- `"L"`				The "L" key.
- `"M"`				The "M" key.
- `"N"`				The "N" key.
- `"O"`				The "O" key.
- `"P"`				The "P" key.
- `"Q"`				The "Q" key.
- `"R"`				The "R" key.
- `"S"`				The "S" key.
- `"T"`				The "T" key.
- `"U"`				The "U" key.
- `"V"`				The "V" key.
- `"W"`				The "W" key.
- `"X"`				The "X" key.
- `"Y"`				The "Y" key.
- `"Z"`				The "Z" key.
- `"SPACE"`			The spacebar.
- `"RETURN"`		The Enter key.
- `"TAB"`			The tabulator key.
- `"ESCAPE"`		The escape key.
- `"BACK_SPACE"`	The backspace key.
- `"CAPS_LOCK"`		The caps lock key.
- `"NUM_LOCK"`		The num lock key.
- `"1"`				The "1" key.
- `"2"`				The "2" key.
- `"3"`				The "3" key.
- `"4"`				The "4" key.
- `"5"`				The "5" key.
- `"6"`				The "6" key.
- `"7"`				The "7" key.
- `"8"`				The "8" key.
- `"9"`				The "9" key.
- `"0"`				The "0" key.
- `"LEFT"`			The arrow 'left' key.
- `"UP"`			The arrow 'up' key.
- `"RIGHT"`			The arrow 'right' key.
- `"DOWN"`			The arrow 'down' key.
- `"INSERT"`		The insert key.
- `"DELETE"`		The delete key.
- `"PAGE_UP"`		The 'Page Up' key.
- `"PAGE_DOWN"`		The 'Page Down' key.
- `"END"`			The end key.
- `"HOME"`			The home key.

## Notation of keycombinations

A keycombination consists of one primary key and optionally one or more modifier keys. *jQuery.Shortcut.js* is very permissive in what it accepts as arguments — write down your keys and separate them with the delimiter sign which is `+` by default.

	// You don't have to care about case
	"ctrl+z"
	"CTRL+Z"
	"Ctrl+Z"

	// You don't have to care about spaces
	" ctrl + Z "
	"ctrl + Z"
	"ctrl+Z"

	// You don't have to care about order
	"alt + Z + meta"
	"meta + alt + Z"
	"Z + meta + alt"

	// You don't even have to care about repetitions
	"meta+meta+meta + Z"

*jQuery.Shortcut.js* parses the keycombination and normalizes it. If you want to gain some performance write your keycombination the normalized way:

	// Normalized shortcut:
	// 1. Write modifierkeys at the beginning
	// 2. Write them lowercase
	// 3. Sort the modifierkeys alphabetically
	// 4. Use + to separate them from each other
	// 5. Don't use any spaces
	// 6. The primary key is at the end
	// 7. The primary key is the only uppercase key

	"meta+shift+BACK_SPACE"
	"ctrl+LEFT"
	"RETURN"
